                                        <p>You should carefully package your item to ensure that it is not damaged in transit. Use old newspapers, bubble wrap, or other environmentally friendly packaging material to cushion your item. iReTron is not responsible for shipping damage that may occur in transit.</p>
                                        <p>Electronic devices require special attention during packaging in order to ensure their safe arrival at the destination. If you have it, package your item first in its original packaging and then secure it in a box with plenty of packing material. If you donâ€™t have the original packaging, antistatic bubble wrap and plenty of extra cushioning should be used when packaging these items. iReTron is not responsible for devices that you ship. If you are uncomfortable with packaging your item yourself, consider having these items professionally packed at a USPS location.</p>
